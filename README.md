## **To run project!**

To run the project you will need a Mircrosoft Visual Studio and SQLite. 
When the project is opened in Microsoft Visual Studio you should make a migration.
First write: **add-migration init**
Then: **update-database**
The database should be in C:\Users\_YOUR USER NAME_\source\repos\CatchSmart\CatchSmart

## **Description**

I made three API Controllers for candidates, companies, and positions.
For candidate controller: 
1. Created a method to create a new candidate.
2. Created a method to add candidates to new positions.
3. Created a method to get a list of companies to which the candidate has applied.
4. Created a method to search for candidates. 
5. Created a method to update candidate skills. 
6. Created a method to delete candidates from a database.
For company controller:
1. Created a method to create a new company.
2. Created a method to add new positions to the company. 
3. Created a method to search for the companies-by-companies name. 
4. Created a method to search for open positions for the company.
5. Created a method to delete a company from the database. 
For position controller:
1. Created a method to search for open positions by title.

If more time would be given: 
1. Would add authentication for companies and candidates.
2. Would add a possibility to add a position description.
